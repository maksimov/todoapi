## TODO API

A demo project to show how concise REST APIs can be built in golang. 

This is to disperse the myth that APIs written in golang cannot be simple and ideomatic like in other programming languages. 

Each folder in this repository represents different stages in an API project's lifecycle:
- basestructure/ : Shows how to structure your REST project into modular bits with expressive routing, handlers and middlewares. Subsequent projects in the folder will build on top of basestructure.
